    <p> 
        This is a delicious, easy, and quick recipe. Children love it.
         <br>Best served with plain white rice and roasted or grilled chicken.
          <br>It reminds me of my childhood as my mother use to make it for us.
          <br> My mam took this recipe from my grandmother.
          <br> It's a traditional Egyptian dish. The best part is that it is an all year recipe.
